Create restricted file downloads for members.

== Description ==

Create and manage restricted file downloads for your membership site. Upload files to a secure, non-public directory and control access based on membership level. Members see a download link; non-members see which level is required and a prompt to join.

Each download is a custom post type with a title, description, and uploaded file. Restrict access using the standard PMPro "Require Membership" panel. Files are stored in the PMPro restricted files directory, protected from direct access.

Display downloads using three templates (link, card, or button) via shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks with live editor previews. The Download Library block and `[pmpro_download_library]` shortcode display multiple downloads in list or grid layouts.

= How It Works =

This Add On registers a Download custom post type. Each Download post holds a single protected file stored in PMPro's restricted files directory — outside of the public WordPress uploads folder.

When a visitor requests a download, PMPro checks their membership level before serving the file. If they don't have the right level, they are shown a locked state with a call-to-action to join or upgrade.

= Displaying Downloads =

Two blocks are available in the block inserter under the PMPro category:

* **PMPro Download** — displays a single download by ID.
* **PMPro Download Library** — displays all published downloads in a list or grid.

Two shortcodes are also available:

* `[pmpro_download id="123" template="link" label="title"]` — displays a single download.
* `[pmpro_download_library template="link" layout="list" columns="2"]` — displays all published downloads.

= Display Templates =

* **Link** — A compact text link with a file-type icon. Locked downloads show a lock icon and the required membership level.
* **Card** — A PMPro-styled card with the download title, optional description, and an action button. Locked downloads show the membership requirement and a "Join Now" or "View Membership Options" button.
* **Button** — A prominent CTA button with a download icon. Locked downloads link to the checkout or levels page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are my uploaded files stored? =

Files are stored in PMPro's restricted uploads directory, which is located outside of the standard WordPress `wp-content/uploads` folder and is protected from direct browser access. Files can only be served through PMPro's authenticated download handler.

= What file types can I upload? =

Any file type that WordPress permits for upload on your site. The allowed file types are controlled by WordPress's standard `upload_mimes` filter.

= Can a member download a file multiple times? =

Yes. There is no download limit per user. Once a member has the correct membership level, they can download the file as many times as they like.

= What happens when I delete a Download post? =

The physical file is permanently deleted from the server when the post is permanently deleted (not just moved to the Trash).

= What happens when I replace a file? =

The old file is deleted from the server only after the new file uploads successfully. If the new upload fails, the original file is preserved.

= Can I display multiple downloads on one page? =

Yes, use the `[pmpro_download_library]` shortcode or block to show all downloads, or place multiple `[pmpro_download id="..."]` shortcodes on the same page.
